## Dividend Ratio Extension

This Chrome extension adds a "Dividend to Price Ratio" column to a specific table on a webpage and allows sorting based on that column.

**Features:**

- Analyzes a designated table on the webpage.
- Calculates and displays the Dividend to Price Ratio for each row.
- Enables sorting the table by the newly added column.

**Installation:**

1. Download the extension folder.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded folder.

**Usage:**

1. Navigate to the target webpage containing the table.
2. The extension will automatically process the table and add the new column.
3. Click on the header of the "Dividend to Price Ratio" column to sort the table in ascending or descending order.

**Note:**

- This extension is currently designed for a specific website and table structure. You might need to modify the code to work on different websites.
- The extension works directly on the DOM of the webpage and may not function if the website structure changes significantly.

**Additional Information:**

- Manifest Version: 3
- Code: `content.js`

I hope this README provides a clear overview of the extension's functionality and usage.
